# Projects Directory

This directory contains all the projects completed during the Oasis Internship.

## Project List

Projects will be added here as they are completed. Each project will have its own folder with:
- Complete source code
- Detailed README with setup instructions
- Documentation
- Any required assets or data

## Adding a New Project

When adding a new project, create a folder with the following structure:

```
project-name/
├── README.md              # Project documentation
├── src/                   # Source code files
│   └── main.{py,js}      # Main application file (main.py or index.js)
├── docs/                  # Additional documentation
├── tests/                 # Test files (optional)
├── assets/                # Images, data files, etc.
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies (if applicable)
├── package.json           # Node.js dependencies (if applicable)
└── .gitignore             # Project-specific ignores
```

## Project README Template

Each project README should include:

1. **Project Title**
2. **Description** - Brief overview of what the project does
3. **Problem Statement** - The problem this project solves
4. **Technologies Used** - List of technologies, frameworks, and tools
5. **Features** - Key features implemented
6. **Installation** - Step-by-step setup instructions
7. **Usage** - How to use the application with examples

9. **Challenges** - Obstacles faced and how they were overcome
10. **Future Enhancements** - Potential improvements
11. **Credits** - Any resources or references used

## Best Practices
